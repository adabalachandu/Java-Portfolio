<p>This is a practice book on interview coding questions. I solved some of the problems from this book. Here is the list-&gt;</p>

</h3>

<ul>
<li>Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?</li>
<li>Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.</li>
<li>Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end of the string to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (Note: if implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.)</li>
<li>Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2blc5a3. If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string.</li>
<li>Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring (e.g., "waterbottLe" is a rotation of "erbottLewat").</li>

<p>This project implements <strong>Singleton</strong>, <strong>Abstract Factory</strong> and <strong>Factory pattern</strong>.</p>

<p>Write a program that creates and prints out the gradebook for a class.  The class consists of 2 kind of students: Graduate and Undergraduate and they have different grading criteria.  The source feed for these 2 students is also in different formats.  Graduate grades are store in an XML format and Undergraduate grades are in JSON format.</p>

<p><code>Grades.xml – XML data file for the student’s grades</code></p>

<p><code>Grades.json – JSON data file for the student’s grades</code></p>

<p><code>•    Each Assigned work grouping with corresponding grades e.g., all Assignments together, all exams together, all quizzes together, …; in chronological order within the assigned work grouping</code></p>

<p><code>•    Final letter grade</code></p>

<p>Note that he grade for an assigned work item can be numeric e.g., 88.5, or letter Grade e.g., A+.  More grading notations are expected.  To work out the final letter grade you need to get a numeric score.  If the original grade was numeric then return the numeric grade, if the score is a letter grade then return the median of the spread for that letter grade.  Use the class syllabus as the guide.</p>

<h3>
<a id="implementation-constraints" class="anchor" href="#implementation-constraints" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Implementation Constraints:</h3>

<p>• You will need Factory Methods for reading in and outputting the Gradebook.  You will also need a Factory Method for the Grade.  More may be needed</p>

<p>• A class is either an undergraduate class or a graduate class, so you will need an Abstract Factory (a.k.a Kit) Pattern to implement the creational classes/objects for the different class gradebooks.  </p>

<p>• Your program can exploit knowledge of the project’s file structure, but cannot assume knowledge on the directory structure outside the project.  One thing this means is that you need to use relative addressing for the path to the input files rather than fixed addressing.  If you hardcode in a path specific to you machine you can be sure it will fail on my machine.</p>

<li> <strong>Interval Scheduling</strong> - <a href="https://github.com/rajeshsurana/Java-Portfolio/blob/master/GreedyAlgorithms/IntervalScheduling.java">view code</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>We have a set of requests {1, 2 ..... n}; the ith request corresponds to an interval of time starting at s(i) and finishing at f(i). We’ll say that a subset of the requests is compatible if no two of them overlap in time, and our goal is to accept as large a compatible subset as possible. Compatible sets of maximum size will be called optimal.</p>

Threaded Design Pattern [<a href="https://github.com/rajeshsurana/Java-Portfolio/tree/master/ThreadedDesignPatterns_NetBeans">view code</a>]</h2>

<p>This project implements <strong>Model-View-Controller</strong>, <strong>Intercepting Design Pattern</strong>.</p>

<p>Background: many companies and applications have rules in place with respect to input/output data.  For example:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Call centers will often filter input messages for words they deem offensive</p></li>
<li><p>Companies will filter passwords to catch passwords that would be too easy to guess.  E.g., a Disney employee using Disney character names for their password</p></li>
<li><p>Salting a password.  This is the process of adding a known string to a user password to make it harder to break</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Your assignment is to implement an MVC pattern that takes as input a password and will display the password and a message if it is valid or invalid according to a set of rules.  You input screen should be form based and allow the user the select the password filter to apply and in what order.
Your filter on the password check should use the Intercepting filter to insert the password checks between the Controller and the Model.</p>

I use Factory method and Singleton pattern to read XML and JSON data. There is also an interface to directly paste XML message which triggers the action on server side. Finally, I show up the XML message returned by the server. </p>

<p>On server side, I store the Food Item data in XML format. I used Jersey framework to provide Level-0 Restful services according to Richardson Maturity Model. Please refer documents in <a href="https://github.com/rajeshsurana/POXoverHTTP/tree/master/Info">Info</a> folder to run the project.</p>

<p>Some important points to know about project before you run it-&gt;</p>

<ol>
<li>Client main program is in edu.asu.cse564.samples.crud.restcl.ui.Gradebook_REST_UI.java</li>
<li>All client server communication is done in JSON format.</li>
<li>Before you start creating graded items you need to create gradebook. </li>
<li>Server can maintain multiple gradebooks at a time.</li>
<li>Item id is created randomly on server side.</li>
<li>Item update will update score and feedback.</li>
<li>To access graded item resource you need gradebook, category, item id and student id.</li>
<li>All gradebook data is saved in JSON file on server side. So, if you stop and start server it will be there.</li>
